                    <p>From a young age, I have been captivated by the wonders of STEM. Joining ATL (Atal Tinkering Lab) at 11, I engaged in various STEM projects, including creating a video game with Unity and developing a device for individuals with hearing impairments. My academic journey at Ditton Park Academy has been marked by high achievements in mathematics and physics, self-learning advanced concepts, and earning medals in math challenges. Practical experiences at the Oxford Science Center and virtual work with Airbus further solidified my skills in Python programming, robotics, and problem-solving. Beyond academics, I am an avid chess player, photographer, and athlete. Passionate about quantum computing, I am eager to leverage this technology for societal benefit, particularly in the medical field. I look forward to pursuing my education and career in an environment that values unity, curiosity, growth, and service, aligning with my aspirations for comprehensive personal and academic development.</p>

                </video>
                <p>In this experience, I made a robot which is line-following robot which follows a black line using an Infrared sensor to complete the project I learnt many things such as the coding language micro python, circuit building, soldering, CAD designing and other character-building lessons such as problem-solving and resilience to solve problems with robot. This knowledge can be helpful in my STEM career and make me eligible for the gold crest award.</p>
                <p>STEM experience organized by the Oxford Science Center marked a significant chapter in my journey. Practical insights gained from companies like GE Healthcare and Oxford PV Working with these company's has given valuable skills which are transferable to any field such as Adaptability and Analytical Thinking as I worked with a team to solve some challenges on some projects which I think would play an important role.</p>
